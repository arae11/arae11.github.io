				<span class="image main"><img src="images/skye2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Alex is a computer science and biomedical science graduate with managerial experience in the media
					analysis and customer service sector, which allowed him to develop his leadership, communication,
					and organisational awareness. His leadership potential has been recognised in two organisations
					leading to promotions, this was in recognition of his ability to build productive working
					relationships.

				</p>
				<p>
					He has also worked in media analysis, helping him develop his strong analytical skills, this coupled
					with his computer science degree finally determined his path into software and testing. His
					analytical skills have transferred from his time as a Team Leader which allowed him to identify
					previously unseen issues. He created a system to predict the demand of produce based on previous
					years in anticipation for the effect of COVID on the industry. This helped the company to meet
					desired targets and reduced financial pressure.
				</p>
				<p>Having spent part of his schooling in Bahrain, Singapore, and the UK, Alex has improved his ability to adapt to varying work and environmental settings.
					Additionally, he has completed spells of voluntary work in India and Malawi,
					giving him an appreciation of a broad range of culture and customs.
				<p>
					Working for Sparta has provided Alex with the ability and confidence to provide meaningful
					consultation to clients. His innate passion for technology and his wide skillset compliments the
					roles and responsibilities that are required of SDET's, making this an ideal profession to pursue.

				<h3>Interests</h3>
				<h4>Leadership and Motivation</h4>
				<p>
					Regular involvement in competitive sports in school and university has made me familiar with working in team environments and accustomed to positive concepts such as self-reflection, growth, and intrinsic motivation. 
					Moreover, being appointed captain of the 2nd XI football team at school provided the opportunity to improve my leadership and motivational capabilities which I transferred to a work environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was assigned as the Vice President of the Gaming Society by my peers at University, allowing me to organise events for large groups of people. 
					This led me to moderate an online community of over 500 members through the Gaming Society Discord server, organising key online social events during the COVID pandemic.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h4>Communication and Organisation</h4>
				<p>
					I was the captain and in-game-leader of a semi-professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team, promoting my communication and organisational skills. 
					Additionally, captained two esports teams in university to compete in the National University Esports League, achieving three 3rd place finishes. 
					This prompted my selection for an “All-Star” match, raising over £500 for the Special Effect charity.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h4>Tech and Creativity</h4>
				<p>
					Amateur content creation in the form of Twitch live-streaming and graphic design has enabled me to develop basic community management and branding skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					High computer literacy has facilitated my rapid self-development, allowing me to emulate professional techniques. 
					This includes strong proficiency in the core Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. 
					In particular the use of Excel’s Data Analysis tools and functions for statistical analysis.
